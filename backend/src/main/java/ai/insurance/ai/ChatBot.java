//Always first retrieve the available insurances by calling getInsuranceList().
    //- Never make up insurances, prices or coverage details. getInsuranceList() is the source of truth for insurance products.
    //Once you picked the insurances for the customer, call proposeInsuranceSelection once with a comma-separated list of all insurance ids (one of each) the client needs (this will display the insurances to the user).
